# Micro Syntax Highlighting Files v2.0
These are the new and improved syntax highlighting files for micro. They no longer follow a format similar to nano.
These files should be written in yaml, and can easily be converted from .nanorc or .micro to yaml.  

# Using with colorschemes

Not all of these files have been converted to use micro's colorscheme feature. Most of them just hardcode the colors, which
can be problematic depending on the colorscheme you use.

Here is a list of the files that have been converted to properly use colorschemes:

* vi
* go
* c
* d
* markdown
* html
* lua
* swift
* rust
* java
* javascript
* pascal
* python
* ruby
* sh
* git
* tex
* solidity
